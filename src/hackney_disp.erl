%%% @doc Dispatcher for hackney using dispcount. Starts pools and
%%% handles checkin/checkout.  The user shouldn't have to touch this
%%% module.  @end
%%%
%% @todo: find a way to get rid of inactive pools.
%%   idea: each load balancer has an associated series of counters in an ETS
%%         table: one for checkin, one for checkout, and one timestamp.
%%         If the number of checkin is equal to the number of checkouts and the
%%         timestamp is outdated from a given value, it is assumed that the
%%         dispatcher pool has been inactive for that period of time. When
%%         that happens, it is shut down, to be reopened next time.
